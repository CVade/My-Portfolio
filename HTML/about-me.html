          <h3>Background/Education</h3>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I spent my undergrad at the University of Iowa studying Psychology, with a special focus on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD), and Creative Writing with the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

          I worked for 2 years post-undergrad for real-world experience, following which I was accepted into Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp where I graduated in January as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          I've always been an avid writer & reader from an early age, with many of the books I'd read and my very active imagination inspiring me to create my own worlds and illustrate countless stories/perspectives within them.
        </dd>
        <dd>        
          Overall, my greatest aspiration is to publish a book that one day inspires another kid like me into writing as well.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          That said, similarly to how an architect can create grand designs for real-life skyscrapers, the goal that drives me professionally as a Web Developer is to help give life and structure to a person's ideas for whole world to see on the internet.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The 1st thing I learned about coding is that there's always more than one solution to a problem, meaning the more experience and creativity I cultivate, the greater the product I can deliver to a hopeful client.

            <h3>Fun Facts About Me</h3>
          </dt>
        <dd>        
          I am a huge Star Wars fan. I was born on May 4th (Star Wars Day) and my father tells me the only reason I wasn't named "Luke" was because he lost a coin toss with my mother.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          I love soccer with a passion, I played many sports growing up, but it was and always will be my 1st love. In 2004, my father and I traveled to Portugal to see the Euro Cup Finals between Greece-Portugal; I would later walk home with him wrapped in a Greek flag after Greece claimed victory!

          From ages 12 to 17 I regularly practiced Taekwondo and would've continued had I been able to visit Korea to be tested for my next black belt rank. I fondly remember serving as an assistant instructor as well from 16 to 17 with my own master, helping teach many of the younger students (ages 10-14).
